# LTSpice Simulation Reports
This repository contains SPICE simulations carried out during my bachelor's as a teaching assistant for the labs EE4035 (Electronics) and ENGR2255 (Electrical). For more complex LTSpice simulations, refer to my other repository, named Bachelor_Reports. The **LTSpice Libraries** folder contains schematics and netlists for various components that are not available in the default LTSpice version.

**_Notice_** : _There might be mistakes in the simulations or calculations. If you find any, feel free to report them at:_ [nigilconnects@gmail.com](mailto:nigilconnects@gmail.com)
